## It's an age-old debate: "Your team beat us this year but if it was _*other year*_, you know we'd win, right?" Let's see.

I've collected and cleaned data from the API at [collegefootballdata.com](https://www.collegefootballdata.com/) to train a classification model predicting the winner of a college football game given average season statistics since 2015. The model is then deployed so users can select any 2 teams from the time period and prove that their team in year X would *actually* beat their friend's team in year Y.

## Overview
This project is divided into 4 parts:
1. [Data Collection and Cleaning](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction/blob/main/data_collection/data_collection.md)
2. [Data Visualization and Exploration](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction/blob/main/eda/exploration.md)
3. [Model Building, Evaluation, and Optimization](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction/blob/main/modeling/modeling.md)
4. Deployment (***TODO***)
