## It's an age-old debate: "Your team beat us this year but if it was _*other year*_, you know we'd win, right? This project seeks to end that debate.

I've collected and cleaned data from the API at [collegefootballdata.com](https://www.collegefootballdata.com/) to train a classification model predicting the winner of a college football game given average season statistics since 2015. The model is then deployed to Streamlit so users can select any 2 teams from the time period and prove that their team in year X would *actually* beat their friend's team in year Y.

## Overview
This project is divided into 3 parts:
1. [Data Collection and Cleaning](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction/blob/main/data_collection.md)
2. Model Building, Evaluation, and Optimization
3. Deployment
