## It's an age-old debate: "Yeah your team is good and beat us this year but if it was the other year, it'd be a different story. This project seeks to end that debate.

I've collected and cleaned data from the API at [collegefootballdata.com](https://www.collegefootballdata.com/) to train a classification model predicting the winner of a college football game given average season statistics from the CFP era (2015 and after). The model is then deployed to Streamlit so users can select any 2 teams from the time period and prove that their team in year X would *actually* beat their friend's team in year Y.

## Overview
This project is divided into 4 parts:
1. [Data Collection and Cleaning](https://github.com/DImsirovic/cfb_game_prediction/data_collection.md)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model Building, Evaluation, and Optimization
4. Deployment
